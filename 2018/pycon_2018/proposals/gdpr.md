# Title

* A Brief History of Data Protection: Policy and Practice
* The Past, Present and Future of Data Protection: Policy and Practice
* Data Protection for Developers: Past, Present, and Future

# Description

In 1970, the German state of Hesse enacted what is widely considered the very first data protection laws. Nearly fifty years later, the European Union is about to implement the strongest, most comprehensive data protection regulation ever, and it's existence will have a rippling effect throughout the entire software industry, not only within the EU, but a global scale as well.

In this talk, we'll examine what the upcoming European regulation means for us as developers, with specific examples of how the existing status quo for data collection, data aggregation and data processing will need to change. When can you collect user's data? What can you collect? What can you do with it?

We'll also explore the most important milestones in the history of data protection, both in policy (the evolution of laws to protect data) and in practice (the advent of technology to better protect data) to see how we got to where we are today.

And finally, we'll take a look at the future of data protection, including what to expect from the upcoming European regulation, and the current challenges we face in the US.

# Who and Why

This talk is for developers who work with data, and want to be knowledgable and current about the latest policies and best practices for protecting their user's data. In addition, this talk is for users of technology themselves, to be able to determine what their rights are with regards to their own data.

The only background knowledge this talk requires is that which almost everyone has: some experience being a user of technology which collects data about them.

After watching this talk, developers should be able to determine if their software projects are affected by the new regulations, and should be informed about how their technology will need to change in order to become compliant with the new laws.
