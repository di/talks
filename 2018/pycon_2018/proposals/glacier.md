# Title

* Anatomy of a Feature
* Embracing the Glacial Pace of Open Source Software
* Embrace the Glacier: Why Open Source Moves So Slowly

# Description

Sometimes it feels like Open Source Software moves an excruciatingly slow pace. Bug reports languish, feature requests acquire +1's and thumbs up but never get shipped. Is this project dead, or are the maintainers just ignoring their users?

In this talk, we'll examine how a seemingly simple feature can become unbelievably complex and take an incredible amount of coordination to finish, taking multiple years from conception to completion.

We'll look at one of the most popular and oft-requested features for the Python Package Index, and dig in to see why it's taken so long to implement. Along the way, we'll develop some methods for identifying complexity, as well as a greater understanding for what it takes to make open source work.

# Who and Why

This talk is for the consumers of open source software, to better understand the complexities and challenges of maintaining the projects they use on a daily basis.

This talk only requires a background knowledge of how open source software works (that it's community driven, volunteer-based, etc).

After watching this talk, the audience should have tools for identifying complexity in feature requests, a greater understanding of the mechanics and limitations of large community-driven software projects, and empathy for open-source maintainers.
