## "I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun."

---

## "[Eventually] we began to feel as if we really were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines. I don't think we are."

---

## "I think we're responsible for stretching them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun."

---

> "Instead of trying to succeed, I was going to try to build things that would fail."

---

> "It's this expression of joy and humility that often gets lost in engineering."

^ 10000 years is just within the limits of plausability

^ we have found artifacts that are approximately that old, but nothing so complex

---

# Design Principles
## *of The Clock of the Long Now*

![](images/prototype_1.jpg)

---

![](images/prototype_1.jpg)

## - Longevity<br>- Maintainability<br>- Transparency<br>- Evolvability<br>- Scalability

^ turns out, the same principles to make a clock last 10K years are good principles for making anything last a long time

---

## "If there is no attention for long periods of time the Clock uses the energy captured by changes in the temperature between day and night on the mountain top above to power its time-keeping apparatus."

^ have you ever tried to build something so ambitious that it required an entirely new form of power?

---

> "Such a clock, if sufficiently impressive and well-engineered, would embody deep time for people."

---

> "It would do for time what the photographs of Earth from space have done for thinking about the environment."

---

> "Such icons reframe the way people think"

^ If placed in unfamiliar territory, it was programmed to search until it reached a known location and then it would proceed to the target, adding the new knowledge to its memory and learning new behavior.
