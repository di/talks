* Open source IRL
* On the beach
* Stop the ride please I'd like to get off

^ this is the part I usually tell people to cut

---

# First exposure:
# early 2000's

^ customize.org, winamp

^ napster, limewire

^ mandrake linux CDs

^ ubuntu

---

# Contributing?
# No

^ I was consuming

^ totally valid way to interact with open source

---

# Second exposure:
# late 2000's

^ college

^ latex

^ python

---

# Contributing?
# Not really

^ had a sparse github with some school projects

^ not a whole lot going on

---

# Open source IRL

^ started a company, everything was open-source

^ it failed

---

# Contributing?
# Maybe

---

# On the beach

^ joined a consultancy

^ 25% time

^ "on the beach" / "on the bench"

---

# Contributing?
# Yes

^ internal projects open-sourced

^ 25% time working on Python stuff

^ just happened to decide to work on warehouse

^ MOSS grant

^ warehouse is now PyPI

# Stop the ride please
# I'd like to get off

# Contributing?
# Very yes

^ maintaining projects, board meetings, strategy from google

^ how much of my day is spent

---

# What I've found

* Open-source value-lag
* Million dollar problem
* How to contribute

---

# Open-source
# value-lag

^ Like playing a video game over an incredibly slow connection

^ used to a tight feedback loop

^ hard to see direct results

^ solution? wait

---

# Million dollar problem

^ everyone who can contribute already has a job

^ solution? normalize paying developers, and consultants

^ focus on grants, pay people as contractors / part time

---

# How to contribute to open source

^ what works and what doesn't

---

# How to contribute to open source

* Hacktoberfest
* "good first issues"
* Linux/Python/etc

---

# How to contribute to open source

* ~~Hacktoberfest~~
* ~~"good first issues"~~
* ~~Linux/Python/etc~~

---

# How to (actually) contribute to open source

1. Determine your dependencies
2. Watch & learn
3. Upstream bug fixes
4. Release for reuse

---

# Determine your dependencies

^ what are they

^ where are the issue trackers

^ are they in danger of being unmaintained?

---

# Watch & learn

^ after you've determined your deps

^ click the watch button

---

# Upstream bug fixes

^ so easy to just point to an internal fork

^ sometimes necessary

^ do it the hard way!

---

# Release for reuse

^ not to show off

^ if you need it, someone else probably does too

^ design it to be generic and reusable

^ someday you might be able to use it across clients as well

# How to contribute: _Consultancy edition_
