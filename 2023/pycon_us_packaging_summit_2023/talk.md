# Hi, I'm Dustin

---

# Why?

---

## Problem:
# Contention for a global namespace

^ too

---

## Problem:
# PEP 541 doesn't scale

^ incredibly onerous and boring

^ very long backlog

^ requires high trust permissions

---

## Problem:
# Typosquatting

^ current policy is necessary but unfortunately restrictive

---

## Problem:
# Dependency confusion

^ orgs want to ensure that package names are restricted for a given prefix

^ this is a namespace!

---

## Problem:
# We now have organizations!

^ guess what the #1 feature request after orgs is

---

## Idea:
# GitHub-style namespaces

---

## Idea:
# Learn from npm[^1]

^ introduced in 2015

---

## Idea:
# No breaking changes

---

# Thoughts?

---

# Thanks!
