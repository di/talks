# Title

* How to contribute to open source
* Everything They Told You About Contributing To Open Source Was Wrong

# Description

Making your first open source contribution isn't hard. What's hard is becoming an engaged contributor for an active project, and making meaningful and important changes that have a lasting effect.

In this talk, we'll dissect the most common pieces of advice that are given with regards to becoming an open source contributor, and why they can be problematic. We'll look at a few examples of how an attempt to contribute can go wrong on so, so many levels, and what can be learned from them.

# Who and Why

This talk is for anyone who has wanted to contribute to an open source project but isn't sure how, anyone who has tried to contribute but has failed, or anyone who actively contributes but wants to become more effective.

This talk only requires a background knowledge of how open source software works (that it's community driven, volunteer-based, etc).

After watching this talk, attendees should feel empowered to become meaningful contributors to at least one open source project of their choosing.
