# Additional Notes

This talk is the result of of my experiences ...

I love to talk about Python and software development in general. I've given talks at PyCon for the last two years, and I also speak frequently at regional Python conferences, including PyGotham, PyTexas, Florida Py. I also speak at local user groups when I can, and have had talks accepted at conferences including PyCon Canada and PyCarribean. Links to my previous talks, slides and videos can be found here: <https://di.codes/speaking>

My PyCon 2016 talk was described by one attendee as "the most concise and understandable discussion of metaclasses I've heard" (<https://twitter.com/amylouboyle/status/737707897270865925>).

I have been a professional Python developer for over ten years and have authored a number of small open-source projects (<https://github.com/di>) including a number of Python packages (<https://pypi.org/user/di/>).

I'm a member of the Python Packaging Working Group, the Python Packaging Authority (<https://github.com/orgs/pypa/people)> and a maintainer of the Warehouse project (<https://pypi.org/>).
