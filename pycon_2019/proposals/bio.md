I love to talk about Python and software development in general. I’ve given talks at PyCon for the last three years, and I also speak frequently at regional Python conferences, including PyCon Canada, PyGotham, PyTexas, PyOhio, Florida Py, and more. Links to my previous talks, slides and videos can be found here: https://di.codes/speaking

My PyCon 2018 talk was standing room only (https://twitter.com/Yhg1s/status/995326519999426566), and my PyCon 2016 talk was described by one attendee as “the most concise and understandable discussion of metaclasses I’ve heard” (https://twitter.com/amylouboyle/status/737707897270865925).

I’m a member of the Python Packaging Working Group, the Python Packaging Authority, and a maintainer, contributor, and administrator of The Python Package Index (https://pypi.org/).

I have been a professional Python developer for over ten years. Currently, I’m a Developer Advocate at Google, focusing on supporting Python users who use Google Cloud Platform.
