# Title

* Software of the "Long Now"

# Description

In the 1990s, a man named Danny Hillis decided he wanted to build a clock that would tick for ten thousand years. In this talk, we'll discuss how the design principles used to build a clock that lasts ten millenia make pretty good guidelines to build anything to last a long time, including software.

We'll examine how these principles apply to a critical piece of Python infrastructure, the Python Package Index, and we'll identify how we as software engineers can create better, more maintainable and longer-lasting software.

# Audience

This talk is for anyone that needs to build software that lasts, whether it is for a month, a year, a decade, or longer.

Attendees should have a general knowledge of software best practices (for example, why it's better to comment your code than not comment it) but don't require any specific background knowledge.

After watching the talk, attendees should have an understanding of how to build "long software" -- e.g., software that is robust, maintainable, understandable, and scalable, as well as how these practices have been adopted into the design of existing software projects, such as the Python Package Index.
