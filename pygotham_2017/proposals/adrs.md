# Title

The Cure for Architectural Amnesia

# Description

How often do you find yourself introducing your codebase to a new teammate, and you can't quite remember why you did something one way, but you're _really_ sure there was a good reason for it?

Or perhaps you're trying to explain the architecture of your software, and the best you can come up with is, "Well, that's the way it's always been, I guess?"

This talk introduces the Architectural Decision Record, which provides a shared history by acting as a collection of architecturally significant decisions, in a succinct, structured format, which describes exactly how something changed at a given point in time.  They provide a way to understand how and why an architecture has evolved as it has grown.

# Who and Why (Audience)

This talk is for anyone who has made architectural decisions on a software project, or needed to understand architectural decisions made by their team.

This talk expects no specific background knowledge, but does assume audience members have either made architectural decisions on a software project, or have worked with a team on a software project that required architectural decisions.

After watching this talk, the audience should understand the need for recording architectural decisions, and also have a simple workflow which they can use as a pattern for recording architectural decisions made by themselves or their team.

# Additional notes

This talk is the result of of my experiences making architectural decisions on large software projects, as well as my blog post on the subject (<https://www.promptworks.com/blog/the-cure-for-architectural-amnesia>).

I talk about Python in some form at least once a month, and some of my previous Python talks have included "Detecting Asteroids with Neural Networks", "wat?  Mind-bending Edge-cases in Python" (PyGotham 2016) and "What Is and What Can Be: An Exploration from `type` to Metaclasses" (PyCon 2016), which was described by one attendee as "the most concise and understandable discussion of metaclasses I've heard" (<https://twitter.com/amylouboyle/status/737707897270865925>).

I have been a professional Python developer for more than ten years and have authored a number of small open-source projects (<https://github.com/di>) including a number of Python packages (<https://pypi.org/user/di/>).

I'm a member of the Python Packaging Working Group, the Python Packaging Authority (<https://github.com/orgs/pypa/people)> and a maintainer of the Warehouse project (<https://pypi.org/>).
