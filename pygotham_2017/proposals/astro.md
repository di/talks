# Title
Detecting Asteroids with Neural Networks in TensorFlow

# Abstract
In this talk, learn how to build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to correctly identify asteroids in astrophotography data using a dataset from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, one of the most ambitious and influential surveys in the history of astronomy.

# Description
TensorFlow is an open-source software library for Machine Intelligence. In this talk, we will learn how to use it to build and train a neural network with the goal of correctly identifying asteroids in astrophotography data. The dataset used will be from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, one of the most ambitious and influential surveys in the history of astronomy.

Using this data, we will learn how to create and featurize a training dataset, build and fit a neural network, and train our model to correctly identify asteroids visible from Earth.

# Who and Why (Audience)
This talk is for a wide range of Python developers, from those who have heard of machine learning, but have never experimented with it, to those who have significant experience with neural networks, but have never used TensorFlow before.

The audience should have some basic Python knowledge, but no formal or informal experience with machine intelligence is assumed.

After watching this talk, the audience should know how to determine and develop features, how and why to build a training dataset, how to build and train a neural network, and some other approaches to supervised learning.

# Additional notes

This talk is based on an experiement to detect asteroids in astrophotography data, which has evolved over a number of years as the landscape of machine intelligence tools has evolved.

I talk about Python in some form at least once a month, and some of my previous Python talks have included "The Fastest Fizzbuzz in the West" (PyCon 2017), "wat?  Mind-bending Edge-cases in Python" (PyGotham 2016) and "What Is and What Can Be: An Exploration from `type` to Metaclasses" (PyCon 2016), which was described by one attendee as "the most concise and understandable discussion of metaclasses I've heard" (<https://twitter.com/amylouboyle/status/737707897270865925>).

I have been a professional Python developer for more than ten years and have authored a number of small open-source projects (<https://github.com/di>) including a number of Python packages (<https://pypi.org/user/di/>).

I'm a member of the Python Packaging Working Group, the Python Packaging Authority (<https://github.com/orgs/pypa/people>) and a maintainer of the Warehouse project (<https://pypi.org/>).
