# Title

* Keeping fun in computing

# Abstract

In this talk, we'll explore how maintaining a sense of fun and whimsy in
science has a profound effect on discovery, innovation and progress.

We'll discuss how you and I can keep computing fun on a day-to-day
basis, maintain and nurture our natural curiosity, and just be open to the
unknown, all to the benefit of our field, those we work with, and ourselves.

# Description

Alan Perlis, the first recipient of the Turing Award, said:

> I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep
> fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun.
> [Eventually] we began to feel as if we really were responsible for the
> successful, error-free perfect use of these machines. I don't think we are. I
> think we're responsible for stretching them, setting them off in new
> directions, and keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of computer
> science never loses its sense of fun.

In this talk, we'll explore how maintaining a sense of fun and whimsy in
science has a profound effect on discovery, innovation and progress.

We'll see how some famous thinkers, including Claude Shannon, Steve Jobs,
Einstein, DaVinci and more followed their natural curiosity to keep science
fun, all to great success.

We'll also talk about some modern examples of how folks are ensuring technology
remains not-so-serious, including the beauty of the lightning talk, the
Stupid Hackathon, Deep Dream, the Clock of the Long Now, Simone Giertz's
robots, and some examples specific to the Python community.

And finally, we'll discuss how you and I can keep computing fun on a day-to-day
basis, maintain and nurture our natural curiosity, and just be open to the
unknown, all to the benefit of our field, those we work with, and ourselves.
