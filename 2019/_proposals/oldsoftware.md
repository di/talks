# Title

* Building software to last 10,000 years

# Abstract



# Description

You just committed some new code and pushed it to production. It's live! But
for how long? A week? A month? A year? How about ten thousand years?

As software developers, we view what we build as being far more ephemeral than
nearly any other profession. The shelf life on our work is usually measured in
years, not decades or centuries.

# Audience

This talk is for anyone that wants to build software that won't just get thrown away in a short amount of time.

Attendees should have a general knowledge of software best practices but don't require any specific background knowledge.

After watching the talk, attendees should have an understanding of how to build software that is robust, maintainable, understandable, and scalable, as well as how these practices have been adopted into the design of existing software projects.
