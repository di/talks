I love to talk about Python and software development in general. I've given talks at PyCon for the last four years, and I also speak frequently at regional Python conferences, including PyCon Canada, PyCascades, PyGotham, PyTexas, PyOhio, Florida Py, PyCarribean, and more. Links to my previous talks, slides and videos can be found here: https://di.codes/speaking

My PyCon 2019 talk was a packed room (https://twitter.com/tryvanillajs/status/1124735498235392000), my 2018 talk was standing room only (https://twitter.com/Yhg1s/status/995326519999426566), and my PyCon 2016 talk was described by one attendee as “the most concise and understandable discussion of metaclasses I've heard” (https://twitter.com/amylouboyle/status/737707897270865925).

I’m a member of the Python Packaging Working Group, the Python Packaging Authority, and a maintainer, contributor, and administrator of The Python Package Index (https://pypi.org/).

I have been a professional Python developer for over ten years. Currently, I’m a Developer Advocate at Google, focusing on supporting Python users who use Google Cloud.
