# Title

* Python == Glue; Python + Serverless == Super Glue

# Description

Python is often called "the second best language for everything", which is a tremendous compliment! As a tool, not only is it a competitive solution for almost any problem, but in addition, it makes great "glue" code. It has the ability to tie together different applications, bridge communication between disparate systems, and even reach down the stack and interoperate with lower level languages as well.

In this talk, we'll see how building serverless applications with Python turns regular glue into "super glue". I'll show how Python with various serverless products can bring together a variety of usually incompatible tools into a cohesive system, and how these applications can be used across the ecosystem to solve just about any problem, all while maintaining the flexibility and scale we have come to expect from serverless platforms. In the end, attendees will have increased knowledge of both what Python can be used for, and how it can be used in a serverless fashion with excellent results.

# Audience

This talk is for anyone who is interested in using Python with various serverless architectures and frameworks.

Attendees should have some background knowledge about how Python can be used generally (as web applications, for machine learning, etc) but don't require any specific knowledge about serverless.

After watching this talk, attendees should understand what "serverless" is, how to write Python code for serverless architectures, some serverless design patterns, and what platforms/frameworks are available for them to do "serverless Python".
