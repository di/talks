# Title

* What's new in Python 3.7

# Description

Python 3.7 is here! In this talk, we’ll explore several new standard library modules, new syntax features and changes, and other performance improvements and implementation changes and what it means for us as Python developers.

We’ll also briefly chat about what exciting things didn’t quite make it into 3.7, but we should expect to see in 3.8.

# Audience

This talk is for Python users who are thinking about switching to Python 3, or are already using an older Python 3 and want to start using Python 3.7.

The only background knowledge required is an understanding that there are multiple versions of Python, each of which introduces new features, fixes bugs, and removes deprecated features.

After watching this talk, attendees should know what new features have been added to Python in 3.7. They should feel motivated to use Python 3.7 in a wide variety of places that support it as a runtime, and should know how to get it and upgrade their Python installation to include Python 3.7.
